# Module 13: A2A Protocol & Agent Communication - Recording Script

**Duration:** 90 min
**Focus:** Agents calling agents, dynamic composition

---

## 🎬 HOOK

**SAY:**
"Hello and welcome to Module 13. Today we're diving deep into Agent-to-Agent communication - the A2A protocol.

This is how you build flexible agent systems where agents can call other agents as tools. It's more dynamic than ParallelAgent - the orchestrator decides which specialists to consult.

By the end, you'll understand when A2A beats ParallelAgent, and you'll build a flexible orchestrator.

Let's go!"
