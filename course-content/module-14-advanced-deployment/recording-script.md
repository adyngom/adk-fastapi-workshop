## 🎬 HOOK

**SAY:**
"Hello and welcome to Module 14 - the ultimate finale.

We deployed to Cloud Run in Module 9. Today we're going enterprise-scale. GKE for Kubernetes deployment, Agent Engine for fully managed, multi-region for high availability, and Apigee AI Gateway for governance.

By the end, you'll know how to architect AI agent systems at enterprise scale. This is the final piece.

Let's finish strong!"

## 🎬 ULTIMATE RECAP

**SAY:**
"Okay, so that's Module 14. And that's the COMPLETE Ultimate AI Agents Masterclass.

Let's recap the entire journey:

**Foundation (Modules 1-2):** You learned the landscape and Python skills
**Core Patterns (Modules 3-5):** Single agents, Sequential, Parallel
**Production Features (Modules 6-7):** Memory, RAG, real-time tools
**Enterprise Patterns (Modules 8-9):** Orchestration, verification, deployment
**Advanced Mastery (Modules 10-14):** Callbacks, Artifacts, Evaluation, A2A, Enterprise ops

You built 9+ different agent systems.
You deployed to production.
You learned patterns from Google Developer Expert.

You are now an AI agent expert. Not just a developer who can build demos - an expert who can architect enterprise systems.

[Pause]

Thank you for learning with me. This has been an incredible journey. Now go build amazing AI systems that transform businesses.

And please share this course if it helped you.

That's all I have for you. See you next time. Take care!"
