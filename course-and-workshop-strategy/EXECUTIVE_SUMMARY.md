## 🚀 Distribution Pipeline (From Single Source)

```
MASTER COURSE (recorded once)
          ↓
    ┌─────┴─────┬─────────┬──────────┬─────────┐
    ↓           ↓         ↓          ↓         ↓
Gumroad/    Virtual   In-Person  YouTube   Udemy
Teachable   $300      $1,500     FREE      $15
$497        Monthly   Quarterly  Modules   Intro
Academy     + Live    + Coaching 1-2       Only
```

**Key Insight:** Record once, distribute everywhere with strategic variations per channel.

---

## 💻 Platform Strategy: Start Cheap, Scale Smart

### Phase 1 (Month 1-3): Gumroad
- **Cost:** $0/month (10% transaction fee only)
- **Why:** Zero risk while validating market
- **Features:** Video delivery, email capture, checkout
- **Limitation:** Basic (no quizzes, no progress tracking)

### Phase 2 (Month 4+): Teachable
- **When:** Revenue > $5k/month (pays for itself)
- **Cost:** $159/month (0% transaction fee on Pro plan)
- **Why:** Professional features justify cost when volume exists
- **Features:** Quizzes, certificates, community, drip content

**Decision Rule:** Migrate when monthly fees < 3% of revenue

---

## 📈 Launch Timeline (8 Weeks to Revenue)

### December: Production
- **Weeks 1-3:** Record all 9 modules
- **Week 4:** Editing + platform setup

### January: Launch
- **Week 1:** Gumroad course live
- **Week 2:** YouTube lead magnets + email to workshop students
- **Week 3:** LinkedIn launch campaign
- **Week 4:** First virtual workshop delivery

### February-March: Scale
- **Monthly virtual workshops** ($300)
- **First premium in-person** ($1,500)
- **Gumroad → Teachable migration** (if revenue justifies)

---

## 🎓 Pricing Strategy: Multi-Tier

### Tier 1: Free (Lead Generation)
- **YouTube:** Modules 1-2 complete
- **GitHub:** Basic workshop code
- **Goal:** Build email list, establish authority

### Tier 2: Self-Paced Academy ($297-$497)
- **Content:** All 9 modules
- **Platform:** Gumroad → Teachable
- **Target:** Individual developers (B2C)

### Tier 3: Virtual Masterclass ($300)
- **Content:** Same 9 modules + live Q&A
- **Delivery:** Zoom, monthly cohorts
- **Target:** Developers wanting community

### Tier 4: Premium In-Person ($1,500)
- **Content:** Same modules + extended labs + coaching
- **Delivery:** In-person, quarterly
- **Target:** Companies, technical leaders (B2B)

**Positioned as value ladder, not competition:** Free → $297 → $300 → $1,500

---

## 🎯 Marketing Strategy: Authority, Not Sales

### LinkedIn (Primary B2B Channel)
- **Cadence:** 3 posts/week
- **Format:** Authority posts (Doctor, not Salesperson)
- **Examples:**
  - "Why 90% of AI projects fail in production"
  - "The $100 stock price mistake" (teaching moment)
  - "When agents handle money, you need accountability" (AP2)
- **Goal:** 5,000 followers by end of year

### YouTube (Primary B2C Channel)
- **Content:** Modules 1-2 free, shorts/clips from modules
- **CTA:** Course link in description with discount code
- **Goal:** 2,000 subscribers by end of year

### Email (Owned Audience)
- **Build from:** YouTube, workshop attendees, course buyers
- **Sequences:** Welcome, sales, workshop nurture
- **Goal:** 1,000+ subscribers by end of year

### Udemy (Lead Generation Only)
- **Content:** Condensed intro (Modules 1-3 only)
- **Price:** $15-20
- **CTA:** Bonus lecture upsells to premium academy
- **Goal:** Funnel to owned platform

---

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Content doesn't sell** | Validated with 40-student workshop; Gumroad = zero monthly cost |
| **Platform costs too high** | Start Gumroad (pays for itself); Migrate only when profitable |
| **ADK gets outdated** | Modular structure (update modules individually); "Living course" model |
| **Can't maintain all channels** | Priority: Academy > Virtual > Premium > YouTube > Udemy |
| **Time commitment too much** | 11 hrs/week part-time schedule; Can extend timeline if needed |
